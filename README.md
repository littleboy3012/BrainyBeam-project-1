Apply mean encoding for the 'Airline' and 'Source' features based on the average ticket price. This will allow the model to better capture the relationship between these categorical variables and the target variable.Create polynomial features for numerical attributes like distance and duration. This will help capture interaction effects and nonlinear relationships that might affect flight prices.Visualize the distribution of flight prices. Analyze how the 'Airline' feature affects flight prices and investigate the relationship between 'Duration' and 'Price' using scatter plots, box plots, or violin plots.
